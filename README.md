# Card Matching Game

A very simple card matching game created with HTML, CSS and Javascript made as a project for college.

It has a basic interface, with a button to Start/Restart the game, a timer and scoreboard.
When the game is over, you are prompted to enter your name so you score can be recorded on the table.

This was a fun project to work on, and one of the first challenges I faced while studying Front-End Interfaces. 
Although it is a simple application, I was really proud of my first fully functioning project.
